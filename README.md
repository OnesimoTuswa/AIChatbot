# AIChatbot
The AI ChatBot is a Cyber-Security Awareness bot that will be tasked to answer any cyber-related questions users might have. 
At the start of the program, there will be a voice greeting followed by an ASCII image of the ChatBot's logo. The user will be prompted enter their name and after they reply, they will be asked how are they doing. 
From there onwards, the ChatBot will instruct you to ask questions. Your questions will be answered to the best of it's ability, but if your question falls out of the ChatBot's range it will kindly tell you so.
The ChatBot will continuously instruct you to ask questions, but if you done doing so you can type "Exit" to leave the program.
The program will be finished and the Chatbot will say goodbye.
